# GoldSrc Rest In Pawn (gRIP) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/In-line/grip.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/In-line/grip)

GRIP started as an effort to make an asynchronous REST API for Pawn.  

Months ago I was invited to participate in the GameX project initiative. GameX was striving to create a modern administrating system for HLDS. To do this many problems queued up, waiting to be solved. One of the major challenges was the interaction with the database. 

A long time ago before GRIP and GameX, web-server and HLDS modified database direcly. It was a crude and a brutal approach, which is one of the sources of todays problems. 
GRIP was created to fill this gap, by providing asynchronous REST Client for Pawn. Database access and modification, with the server-specific code are deligated to the server and encapsulated in REST API, which is a sophysticated and modern approach.

Before we proceed, I should mention that HLDS and Pawn operate on the main thread. Generally code isn't concurrent. 

So to sum up there are 3 key requirements for the GRIP. 
1) Low-latency
2) Asynchronous API
3) Support for the modern web standards.
4) Builtin JSON support (to bypass limits on the AMXX buffer sizes)

Solutions implemented before, usually achieved only second requirement or just basically nothing. They used raw sockets and blocked the main thread for the IO. 
To solve blocking problem requests were dispatched to another thread (See for SQL_ThreadQuery for example). This approach has several problems. One of them is the difficulty on concurrent and safe programming in C++. To speed up things, thread pool should be written. To write a fast thread pool you need to be a highly professional programmer... This is just a mess! 

Why don't use modern programming language which is as fast as C++, but is safe, has greater libraries and tooling support? Yeah, basically no reasons to not to.  

Rust has many libraries dedicated to high-performance HTTP(s) requests, implemented (at the lowest level) using non-blocking sockets. It is extremely easy to write something in Rust, which is otherwise nearly impossible in C++. 

Thus, I, with the team of dedicated supporters give a birth to a GRIP. It supports modern web standards, will eventually support JSON and many other things..

## API 

To familiarize yourself with the API you need little to no knowledge about it's inner structure. You should be familiar with Pawn scripting language in the context of the AMX Mod X and REST API.

First of all, let's see whats the most important point. All the necessary optimizations are done under the hood, developer is exposed only to the high-level view of the things.

You start a request with the corresponding arguments and just after that, function returns immediately. There is no blocking and no way to achieve it by design.

Next I think it is important to describe idiomatic callback implementation. User is forced to provide completion handler, which is guaranteed to be called in the case of success, timeout, cancelation, etc.. Requests completion order is unspecified. On completion, response status should be checked. No function silently failes. it is strict API which forces users to consider all cases. All network requests are done simultaneously in the implementation specified order.

JSON API tries to mimic corresponding `json.inc` file from AMX Mod X. Some things were removed/changed, because in my opinion they are bad design choices. Such dangerous components should rarely cause compilation errors in the plugin, but in the majority of the cases gRIP JSON API is drop-in replacemant of AMX Mod X `json.inc` .
